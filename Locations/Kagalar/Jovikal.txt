[[DESCRIPTION]]
Jovikal is a large city for commerce, military, and politics. It is built around the center of the continent Kregsorin, and is about 80,000 hectares in size. Tall buildings and skyscrapers dominate the city.

Military warships can be seen flying overhead patrolling the city, while some commercial spacecraft can be seen flying overhead while they play pre-recorded advertising voicelines.

Roads for cars are on the ground, while there are trains that transport people over the road.

During the winter, it starts to snow. Usually the road and highway is free of any snow because the heat generated by plasma-based machinery melts them.

A battleship construction space station can be seen hovering thousands of kilometers above the city, with about five battleships parked at the station, and one in construction.
