Note:
	All energy weapons have a core. The color of it's bolt corresponds with it's crystal color.
	AI is expensive, so armies tend to not use AI to replace infantry.

Crystals and metals:
	Crystals:
		Mrokek (Unstable, glowing blue crystal with dark spots, used for weapons and explosives)
		Phystine (Glowing pale red crystal, used for weapons and explosives)
		Exite (Glowing pale green crystal, used for weapons and explosives)
		Mroken (Glowing blue crystal, used for heaters)
		Elinar (Glowing white crystal, used for making potion powders)
		Ulsinan (Glowing purple crystal, richer version of elinar)

		Distintite (Beatiful white and green crystal)
		Nalastite (Beautiful purple and blue crystal)
		Quastarine (Beautiful glowing purple crystal)
		Morigalt (Beautiful green and yellow crystal)
		Korin (Beautiful deep blue crystal)
		Illisinion (Beautiful brightly white crystal with traces of gold)

	Metals:
		Fresenite (Hard white metal, used for armors, spaceships and structures, specifically used by the Kagarian Empire and their allies)
		Arsenium (Brown metal, used for wiring)
		Graltite (Gray metal, used for chips)

		Jestarine (Beautiful deep green rock, with small traces of aqua)

Weapons:
	Energy Rifle:
		Type: Energy rifle
		Length: About 60 cm long
		Projectile: Bolt of energy, 300 m/s
		On impact: The bolts explode in a small shower of sparks, burning what ever it touches.
		Designs:
			KAG Energy Rifle 114 (KAGER 114, uses mrokek)
			Queendom's Rifle 3 (uses phystine)
			Reedian Energy Rifle 15 (RER 15, uses exite)

		Function: In the rifle, a fast, strong burst of electricity is released through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive energy. This burst of explosive energy is pushed through a thin tube out of the rifle, supercompressing it in the process. The supercompressed burst of energy that comes out of the rifle is the bolt of energy. In attempt to cool down the weapon from heating, the barrel is enclosed by a sealed tank of liquid nitrogen. Because of this, the metal of an energy rifle that hasn't been fired in a while will feel very cold.

	Concentrated Energy Rifle
		Type: Energy Rifle
		Length: About 100 cm long
		Projectile: Thin beam of energy, 300 m/s
		Designs:
			KAG Stream Rifle Prototype 4

		Function: In the rifle, a continuous electrical current passes through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive energy. The explosive energy is pushed through a thin tube, shooting out like a deadly water cannon.

	Unstable Crystal Warhead
		Type: Warhead
		Function: The warhead is tipped with an unstable crystal. When this crystal is struck, it releases a high amount of explosive energy. The crystal on the tip of the warhead is actually connected to a larger piece in the middle of the missile, which is enclosed with a hard metal. Because the unstable crystal released a lot of energy, this energy is contained inside the missile. The missile cannot contain this much energy, so the missile explodes.

	Unstable Crystal Missile
		Type: Missile
		Radius: 20 cm
		Length: 2 meters
		Lethal Range: 15 m
		Function: Uses a crystal warhead, propelled by a crystal rocket engine.

*Note: All ships have superhard solar panels

Ship Modules:
	==================== SPACECRAFT ESSENTIALS ====================

	Warship Core:
		Function: A large block of batteries, to store solar energy. Can be charged directly while docked.

	Warship Gyroscope:
		Function: Four gyroscopes that spin rapidly. These ensure the ship stays stable. If used with larger ships (battleships), there would be four gyroscopes on the very front and very back of the ship.

	Superhard Panels:
		Function: Solar panels that are really hard to destroy, using hard glass similar to bulletproof glass.

	Crystal Core Rocket Engines:
		Function: Most warships will have four engines to push forward, and eight engines on a 45 degree angle to turn around.
		Example (| and \ and / are engines):

			 |        |
			/\        /\ 
			 /\______/\
		        | |

	==================== SPACECRAFT ESSENTIALS ====================

	Wormhole Transport Module:
		Function: When used, it creates a wormhole. The wormhole The wormhole transports everything it enters into a specific location very fast. Between planets take 30 seconds, star systems take 10 minutes, galaxies take a week. Once nothing has entered it for the past 3 seconds, it closes.
		Wormhole Appearance: It appears like a giant gray smoky ring, big enough to fit the ship that used it. Green lightning rapidly connects random points of the ring, creating flashes of green.

	Shield Generator Module:
		Function: Generates a forcefield around a ship. The forcefield appears to distort light like flowing water. When struck, it creates a bright flash of white light, and stops the object from entering. A ship cannot land while it's shield is up, and everything is prevented from entering or leaving. The only thing that can enter is light, gas, radiation and heat. Laser Projectors can shoot through shields, although because it distorts light, the laser is not garanteed to hit.

	Mirror Armor Module:
		Function: Many mirrors are installed on the ship's hull. A ship with this module installed on it's hull is hard to see, and laser weapons are almost useless against ships with this module installed.

Armor Modules:
	Supercooling Module:
		Function: Cools down armor to -20c, hopefully to negate the damage of energy bolts. Also creates a cold aura around the armor, weakening energy bolts.

Misc:
	Cloning Machine:
		Type: Cloning Machine
		Height: 3 meters
		Function: To assign someone to clone, they step into the machine. The machine reads their body, and their properties, like IQ, strength, height, weight, immune system etc. It cannot read magic properties. Then the machine is ready to clone. To grow a clone, it will take half a day to create one. These machines to not require any resource to create a clone, other than electricity to power it.

	Energy Emitter:
		Size: 6 x 6 x 2 cm
		Function: To create a shield, you need four of these. Place them in a way so that all the faces of the four boxes are either parallel to each other. To activate them, you need to assign the four of them to a remote controller like bluetooth.

	Long Range Radio:
		Type: Radio
		Size: 20 x 6 x 4 cm
		Function: Allows communication across galaxies, universes and worlds because yes. To talk to each other, you assign the radio to an id. There can never be two radios with the same ID. You connect to this ID on another radio with a password required. Then you can communicate.
