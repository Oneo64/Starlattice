The **nanopus** (Kagalarian: *мольмба*) is a nine-armed starfish-like creature native to the planet Kagalar.

## Appearance
The nanpous looks like a starfish with nine legs. They are mono-eyed, which is similar to a human eye. Their eye is located at the center, and their mouth is right below it. Their slimy skin can range from green to yellow. Their legs can stick to surfaces due to suction cups.

## Behaviour
Nanopi latch onto trees and hide in the leaves, where they live in colonies. When they are hungry, they will come down and stay on the trunk, looking for prey. A nanopus colony can consist of tens of nanopi, all living in no more than several trees in one spot.

They kill by jumping onto the victim and trying to strangle them with their arms.

Their diet is mostly carnivorous and omnivorous animals, which includes humans. They don't prey on herbivores.
