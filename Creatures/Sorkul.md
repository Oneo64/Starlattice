The sorkul is a monster native to many planets.

## Etymology
The term *sorkul* is a romanisation of the Kagalarian word *соркьл*, which has the same meaning.

## Appearance
Sorkuls are large, dog-like creatures. Their fur is black and they have a mouth for a head. The mouth expands to cover the entire neck, and the teeth point horizontally instead of vertically. They have four small, black eyes, which are almost invisible with their dark fur. The eyes are located on the top, bottom, left, and right of the neck.

## Abilities
Sorkuls are about as fast as a dog, reaching up to 15 m/s at top speed. Their digestive system allows they to eat almost anything.

Sorkuls prey on anything that can move. In a sorkul encounter, if the victim cannot outrun a sorkul, climb a tree, or get to a safe spot, it's best to play dead.
