It was 1913 when magic crystals were discovered on the planet Ramalosedot. About fifty years later, spacecraft were invented. After this major turn of events, practised magic was slowly forgotten in favour of technology. After many, many years, even with all the amazing technology discovered, war still rages, and that's because war never changes.
