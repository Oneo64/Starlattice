Starlattice is a science fiction worldbuilding project built and developed by Oneo64, also called Fantasy in Space in older versions. The world is set in 2040, and follows the genre Industrial Space Opera.

True to its genre, the world Starlattice houses extremely advanced technology compared to Earth. Magic crystals, a key component in many military tech and civilian gadgets, are used to create various things such as plasma-firing weapons, wormhole travel, and even long-distance radios. Technology doesn't give off the look of many little tidbits put onto a surface, but clean and concise modernity. *(Comparable to something like a Tesla car in a bustling city.)*

It was 1913 when magic crystals were discovered on the planet Ramalosedot. About fifty years later, spacecraft were invented. After this major turn of events, practised magic was slowly forgotten in favour of technology. After many, many years, even with all the amazing technology discovered, war still rages, and that's because war never changes.
