Duration:
	For each ingredient including the powder base, the potion lasts 10 minutes.

	If a sip was taken, divide duration by ten.
	For each oz drank, multiply by 0.5. (Example. 5 oz = multiply by 2.5, 2 oz = multuply by 1)

How to brew a potion:
	1.  Prepare a brewing base. Each brewing base acts as catalyst.
	1a. A brewing base requires the powder of an enchanting crystal, and any amount of magic crystal powder.
	1b. The approximate ratio required enchanting powder to magic powder is 1:2. (1/3 enchanting crystal, 2/3 magic crystal)
	1c. Enchanting powder works the magic, and magic powder stores the potion's effect. Not following the ratio means lowered potency.
	2.  Mix the brewing base with water, which can be dirty or clean, but the water must not be gooey or like an oil.
	3.  Dump the ingredients in, and let it sit for a day. Make sure the potion isn't gooey, like in step 2.
	4.  It's recommended to stir it before taking it out of it's container, or shake the vial before drinking it. If it was recently boiled, no stiring is required.
