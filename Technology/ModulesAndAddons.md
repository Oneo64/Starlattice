## Essential Spacecraft Modules
#### Gravity Simulation Module
Simulates gravity in a 5 cm x 3 m x 5 cm radius. Usually, the floor of a ship is covered with these. These also reduce any g-force, allowing spacefighters to speed up or slow down at greater speeds without damaging their occupants.

#### Warship Gyroscopes
Four gyroscopes that spin rapidly. These ensure the ship stays stable. If used with larger ships (battleships), there would be four gyroscopes on the very front and very back of the ship.

#### Crystal Core Rocket Engines
Most warships will have four engines to push forward, and eight engines on a 45-degree angle to turn around.

#### Solar Energy Panels
All solar energy panel systems will always come in two parts.

 - **Mega-Giant Battery:** A large block of batteries to store solar energy. Can be charged directly while docked.
 - **Superhard Panels:** Solar panels that are really hard to destroy, using hard glass similar to bulletproof glass.

#### Crystal Core Reactor
A sphere of crystal, about 3 meters in radius. This core is zapped by electricity, which produces plasma. This plasma is somehow converted into electricity. The reactor then takes a portion of the electricity and reuses it to zap itself, producing MORE plasma. The cycle repeats.

Of course, there is also an automatic fail-safe system. When the amount of plasma inside the reactor reaches over a certain maximum, the reactor temporarily stops working until the plasma lowers to half the set maximum.

## Optional Spacecraft Modules
#### Wormhole Transport Module
This module is an FTL system installed on a ship to create travelling wormholes using a magical crystal. Even though the travelling speed in the wormhole is about 2000 m/s (2 mn/s), the travelling speed to the target is much faster. The most powerful models can create wormholes with an exterior speed of 1000 AU/s.

When materialised, the wormhole appears as a giant, grey, smoky ring, big enough to fit the ship that created it. Green lightning rapidly connects random points of the ring, creating flashes of green.

###### Travel times
 - **Across a planet:** 5 to 15 seconds *(wormhole strength at 0.00006 AU/s, or 10 mn/s)*
 - **Between planets:** 1 to 3 minutes *(wormhole strength at 0.006 AU/s, or 897.6 mn/s)*
 - **Across a star system:** 30 minutes *(wormhole strength at 0.006 AU/s, or 897.6 mn/s)*
 - **Between star systems:** 4+ hours *(at full wormhole strength, which is 1000 AU/s, or 150,000 kn/s)*
 - **Between far-away star systems:** 2+ days *(at full wormhole strength, which is 1000 AU/s, or 150,000 kn/s)*
 - **Across a galaxy:** approximately 72 days *(at full wormhole strength, which is 1000 AU/s, or 150,000 kn/s)*

#### Shield Generator Module
Generates a force field around a ship. The force field acts like an inverted gravity field that pushes things away instead of pulling them in. This force field has a maximum distance of affection.

The forcefield appears to distort light like flowing water. When struck, it creates a bright flash of white light and stops the object from entering.

The shield can block solids, liquids, and plasmas. The only things that can enter are light, gas, radiation and heat. This means that lasers (not energy weapons!) can shoot through shields, but because the shield distorts light, the laser becomes unfocused.

Because the shield blocks solids, a ship cannot land while its shield is activated.

#### Radar Module
Basic radar systems. Each ship usually has 6 points where radar waves are fired off, one on the top, bottom, front, back, left, and right side. This info is usually sent to the command deck. The radar can detect ships up to 10,000 kilometres (10 maglonakins) away.

The radar returns its distance outputs in maglonakins.

#### Military-grade Radar Module
Basic radar systems. Each ship usually has 6 points where radar waves are fired off, one on the top, bottom, front, back, left, and right side. This info is usually sent to the command deck. The radar can detect ships up to 1,000,000 kilometres (1 kacholnakin) away.

The radar returns its distance outputs in maglonakins.

#### Mirror Armor Module
Many mirrors are installed on the ship's hull. Laser weapons are almost useless against ships with this module installed, and are much harder to see during daytime or inside nebulae.

## Armour Modules
#### Supercooling Module
Uses liquid nitrogen (only a little) to cool down armour, hopefully to negate the damage of plasma bolts. Also creates a cold aura around the armour, weakening plasma bolts.
