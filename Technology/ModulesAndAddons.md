## Essential Spacecraft Modules
#### Gravity Simulation Module
Simulates gravity in a 5 cm x 3 m x 5 cm radius. Usually the floor of a ship is covered with these. These also reduce any g-force, allowing spacefighters to speed up or slow down at greater speeds without damaging it's occupants.

#### Warship Gyroscopes
Four gyroscopes that spin rapidly. These ensure the ship stays stable. If used with larger ships (battleships), there would be four gyroscopes on the very front and very back of the ship.

#### Crystal Core Rocket Engines
Most warships will have four engines to push forward, and eight engines on a 45 degree angle to turn around.

#### Solar Energy Panels
All solar energy panel systems will always come in two parts.

 - **Mega-Giant Battery:** A large block of batteries, to store solar energy. Can be charged directly while docked.
 - **Superhard Panels:** Solar panels that are really hard to destroy, using hard glass similar to bulletproof glass.

#### Crystal Core Reactor
A sphere of crystal, about 3 meters in radius. This core is zapped by electricity, which produces plasma. This plasma is somehow converted into electricity. The reactor then takes a portion of the electricity, and reuses it to zap itself, producing MORE plasma. The cycle repeats.

Of course, there is also an automatic fail-safe system. When the amount of plasma inside the reactor reaches over a certain maximum, the reactor temporarily stops working until the plasma lowers to half the set maximum.

## Optional Spacecraft Modules
#### Wormhole Transport Module
Uses a magical crystal to create wormholes. The wormhole The wormhole transports everything it enters into a specific location very fast. Between planets take around 30 seconds, and between star systems take 30 minutes to an hour (extremely far away star systems can take 6+ hours). Once nothing has entered it for the past 3 seconds, it closes. It can move ships and other things that enter up to 2000 AU/s (~300,000 kn/s), between planets 0.006 AU/s (897.6 mn/s) is usually used for precision reasons. The actual traveling speed in the wormhole is about 2000 m/s (2 mn/s).

It appears like a giant gray smoky ring, big enough to fit the ship that used it. Green lightning rapidly connects random points of the ring, creating flashes of green.

#### Shield Generator Module
Generates a forcefield around a ship. The forcefield is like an inverted gravity field, that pushes stuff out, instead of in. It also only affects objects at a specific distance. The forcefield appears to distort light like flowing water. When struck, it creates a bright flash of white light, and stops the object from entering. A ship cannot land while it's shield is up, and everything is prevented from entering. The only thing that can enter is light, gas, radiation and heat. Lasers (not energy weapons!) can shoot through shields, although because it distorts light, the laser is not garanteed to hit. For some reason, the shield doesn't affect gases. If something is solid, liquid, or plasma, the shield can block it.

#### Radar Module
Basic radar systems. Each ship usually has 6 points where radar waves are fired off, one on the top, bottom, front, back, left, and right side. This info is usually sent to the command deck. The radar can detect ships up to 10,000 kilometers (10 maglonakins) away.

The radar returns its distance outputs in maglonakins.

#### Military-grade Radar Module
Basic radar systems. Each ship usually has 6 points where radar waves are fired off, one on the top, bottom, front, back, left, and right side. This info is usually sent to the command deck. The radar can detect ships up to 1,000,000 kilometers (1 kacholnakin) away.

The radar returns its distance outputs in maglonakins.

#### Mirror Armor Module
Many mirrors are installed on the ship's hull. Laser weapons are almost useless against ships with this module installed, and are much harder to see during daytime or inside nebulae.

## Armour Modules
#### Supercooling Module
Uses liquid nitrogen (only a little) to cool down armor, hopefully to negate the damage of plasma bolts. Also creates a cold aura around the armor, weakening plasma bolts.
