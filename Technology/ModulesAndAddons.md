# Modules and Addons
Modules are essentially like an external program in a computer; they can be added onto an existing system to enhance what they can do or modify their function.

However, modules cannot simply be attached to what they are going to modify. A person who wants their device, vehicle, or vessel modified must get an engineer or someone proficient in adding them.

- **kn/s:** kacholnakins per second

## Essential Spacecraft Modules
#### Gravity Simulation Module
Simulates gravity in a 5 cm x 3 m x 5 cm radius. Usually, the floor of a ship is covered with these. These also reduce any g-force, allowing spacefighters to speed up or slow down at greater speeds without damaging their occupants.

#### Warship Gyroscopes
Four gyroscopes that spin rapidly. These ensure the ship stays stable. If used with larger ships (battleships), there would be four gyroscopes on the very front and very back of the ship.

#### Crystal Core Rocket Engines
Most warships will have four engines to push forward, and eight engines on a 45-degree angle to turn around.

#### Solar Energy Panels
All solar energy panel systems will always come in two parts.

 - **Mega-Giant Battery:** A large block of batteries to store solar energy. Can be charged directly while docked.
 - **Superhard Panels:** Solar panels that are really hard to destroy, using hard glass similar to bulletproof glass.

#### Crystal Core Reactor
A sphere of crystal, about 3 meters in radius. This core is zapped by electricity, which produces plasma. This plasma is somehow converted into electricity. The reactor then takes a portion of the electricity and reuses it to zap itself, producing MORE plasma. The cycle repeats.

Of course, there is also an automatic fail-safe system. When the amount of plasma inside the reactor reaches over a certain maximum, the reactor temporarily stops working until the plasma lowers to half the set maximum.

## Optional Spacecraft Modules
#### Wormhole Transport Module
An extremely useful addon in military fleets, this module is an FTL system installed on a ship to create travelling wormholes using a magical crystal. Even though the travelling speed in the wormhole is about 2000 m/s (2 mn/s), the travelling speed to the target is much faster. The most powerful models can create wormholes with an exterior speed of 10000 AU/s.

When materialised, the wormhole appears as a giant, grey, smoky ring, big enough to fit the ship that created it. Green lightning rapidly connects random points of the ring, creating flashes of green.

###### Travel times
 - **Across a planet:** 5 to 15 seconds *(wormhole strength at 0.00006 AU/s, or 10 mn/s)*
 - **Between planets:** 1 to 3 minutes *(wormhole strength at 0.006 AU/s, or 897.6 mn/s)*
 - **Across a star system:** 30 minutes *(wormhole strength at 0.006 AU/s, or 897.6 mn/s)*
 - **Between star systems:** 2+ hours *(wormhole strength at 2000 AU/s, or 300,000 kn/s)*
 - **Between far-away star systems:** 2+ days *(wormhole strength at 2000 AU/s, or 300,000 kn/s)*
 - **Across a galaxy:** approximately 19 years *(at full wormhole strength, which is 10,000 AU/s, or 1,500,000 kn/s)*

#### Engine Overdrivers
An older, but still useful module, engine overdrivers are installed onto the rocket engines of a spaceship. When activated, they cause the engine to power up to more than five times their maximum output (increasing speed by 5 times) in exchange for burning power faster.

Some cheaper models may only be able to overdrive the engines twice the normal output.

#### Shield Generator Module
Shield generator modules are a spectacle in modern engineering. It works by generating a repulsion field around the surface of a ship, pushing things that are too close away. When generated, the field is almost invisible except for its slight distortion of light (like flowing water). When they are struck, they create a bright flash of white light and hinder the object from entering.

Since it is a repulsion field, it dissipates plasma bolts almost instantly, slows down physical bullets, and dampens explosion shockwaves. The only things that are largely unaffected are light, gas, radiation, and heat. This means that lasers (not energy weapons!) can shoot through shields, but because the shield distorts light, the laser becomes unfocused.

Because shields can damage their ships' landing legs by being generated overlapping them, it is advised to ship commanders not to land while their shield is activated.

#### Radar Module
Basic radar systems. Each ship usually has 6 points where radar waves are fired off, one on the top, bottom, front, back, left, and right side. This info is usually sent to the command deck. The radar can detect ships up to 10,000 kilometres (10 maglonakins) away.

The radar returns its distance outputs in maglonakins.

#### Military-grade Radar Module
Basic radar systems. Each ship usually has 6 points where radar waves are fired off, one on the top, bottom, front, back, left, and right side. This info is usually sent to the command deck. The radar can detect ships up to 1,000,000 kilometres (1 kacholnakin) away.

The radar returns its distance outputs in maglonakins.

#### Mirror Armour Module
This type of module involves using a prism-textured mirror surface to weaken harmful lasers. This type of armour usually comes in panels, cut and fitted onto a ship's hull. Inside the mirror is a coating of an aluminum and fresenite mixture.

## Power Armour Modules
### Power modules
#### Portable Crystal Reactor
A small reactor made of an unstable crystal. This works the same way a Crystal Core Reactor works, but on a smaller scale.

### Defensive modules
#### Advanced Point Laser Defense
A point laser defence point is a small automated laser turret built onto the armour. These lasers can reach up to 10 meters, and they use a mix of colour-based and heat-based targeting systems. Because of this, if the targeting system is set to "red", it may attack any warm-blooded creature or warm object that is colored a certain amount of red.

#### Advanced Blast Protection Shields
Blast protection shields are a forcefield that forms on the surface of the power armour. It protects from all forms of physical and energy attacks.

The shielding can take 20 AK-47 shots, 20 plasma blasts, 10 high-speed repeater plasma blasts, or 1 (and a half) artillery explosions (mortar) before it runs out of energy.

#### Blast Protection Shields
Blast protection shields are a forcefield that forms on the surface of the power armour. It protects from all forms of physical and energy attacks.

The shielding can take 5 AK-47 shots, 5 plasma blasts, 2 high-speed repeater plasma blasts, or subdue one artillery explosion (mortar) before it runs out of energy.

#### Landing Protection Thrusters
The landing protection thrusters can detect whether the user is moving too fast (more than 15 m/s) in the direction it is facing. If it detects that the user is moving too fast, it automatically activates, which will slow the user down.

#### Point Laser Defense
A point laser defence point is a small automated laser turret built onto the armour. These lasers can reach up to 10 meters, and they use a colour-based targeting system. Because of this, if the targeting system is set to "red", it may attack anyone who is wearing a certain amount of red. However, it may mistake a red flag or a red flower pot for an enemy and attack it instead.

### Scanning modules
#### Material Scanner
The material scanner is a scanning device that can be mounted anywhere. It takes a few seconds to scan, which will then send its data to a small screen. When the scan is complete, a list of the top 5 elements found in the scan is returned, including their composition percentage, periodic symbol, state of matter, and percentage of neutrons, protons, and electrons.

#### Nightvision and Heatvision Camera
The nightvision and heatvision cameras streamline data to a small screen inside the helmet.

#### Radiation Sampler
The radiation sampler samples a small amount of the outside air and sends the data to a small screen inside the helmet, which then displays the radiation levels.

#### Rangesight Camera
The rangesight camera is a camera that is designed to zoom in on faraway objects. Standing at 1 kilometre away, you should be able to see an apple on a table just clear enough to make out what it is.

### Movement modules
#### Jumping Thrusters
The jumping burst thrusters are an extremely weak version of a warship engine, capable of only releasing a quick burst of energy before heating up. When activated, these jump thrusters can be used to propel the user about 10 meters up in the air.

#### Hand-Based Burst Thrusters
The hand-based burst thrusters are an extremely weak version of a warship engine, capable of only releasing a quick burst of energy before heating up. When activated, these hand-based burst thrusters can be used to propel the user a meter in any direction. These thusters can also be used offensively, but the user must be at least a metre close to the intended target for the plasma exhaust to hit. Even though this plasma exhaust is around 350 degrees Celsius, it isn't hot enough to start a fire since the plasma dissipates into the air too quickly.

#### Striding Exoskeletons
This module is built on the back of the legs, which amplify the speed the user can run from 7 m/s to 14 m/s.

### Environmental modules
#### Heat Regulation System
The heat regulation system is self-explanatory; it allows the user to change the temperature in their armour. This module is effective only in temperatures -250 °C to 50 °C.

### Communication modules
#### Speaker and Microphone
The speaker and microphone allow clear communication outside the power armour. But, because this module is much smaller than a regular handheld radio, the sound quality isn't as good.
