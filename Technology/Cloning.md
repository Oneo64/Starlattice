# Cloning
Cloning is a widely used technology in militaries across the Starlattice universe, involving dedicated incubators taking a model human to replicate his or her genetics. Growing a clone is an expensive and time-consuming process, requiring a source of fresh oxygen and water to build its body, as well as a substantial electrical power source for the machine itself.

A cloning incubator, when first run, must be configured using a person's DNA sample and brain scan. Then, after it is activated, it will take a couple of months to build a clone from the feet to the head. Once the clone's body is complete, the incubator will begin programming its brain to match the brain scan. This process takes a week. When the clone is fully finished, the incubator will open and wake the clone.

Clones' personalities are usually colder and more rigid than humans, even if they don't act that way. Their emotional range is half that of a human's, making them unsuitable as civilians and more useful as soldiers/guards. For example, they are unable to experience overbearing joy or trauma, unable to feel extreme pleasure and torment, and cannot fall in love. Still, a clone needs food and water, and sleep, just like any other human.

Even though a clone isn't as good in design as a human, they are still considered people in law and order due to their capability of emotions and similar biology.

One way to tell a clone from a human, aside from their lack of extreme emotion, is their DNA. Some of a clone's DNA can show small artifacts, small imperfections that do not match any other sample. By sampling four DNA samples, one from each hand and each leg, if any one of them shows a small artifact in DNA structure, they are a clone.

But a dark aspect of these machines is what happens when they shut off unexpectedly. If an incubator is running and there is a clone inside, shutting it off results in its instant death. Even if the clone isn't finished growing, like if only the feet were built, then shutting it off results in a pair of mutilated feet.

## Programming the brain
During the brain programming period, the incubator will use the model human's brain to program the clone, meaning that basic life skills like hygiene, language, and bodily movement are automatically programmed. Memories, however, are skipped by the incubator's software.

Since the software that programs the clone's brain isn't perfectly failsafe when replicating knowledge, it must take reference from a person who has absolutely no mental disorder or bad trauma.

Programming smarter brains requires more time, making it better to train clones after they have awoken. That is also the reason why scientists tend to spend a bit of time (typically a few days to a week) removing brain data after a scan.
