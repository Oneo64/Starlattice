# Weapons
## Types
#### Plasmatic Weapons
Plasmatic weapons are plasma-firing weapons that utilize a crystal core. Most plasmatic weapons fire a bolt by releasing a burst of electricity into their core. The core, due to its special properties, converts the electrical charge into explosive plasma and emits it back out. The plasma is then contained by a small containment field generator in the weapon and expelled out the barrel. The contained burst of plasma that emerges from the weapon is known as the plasma bolt.

Because these weapons tend to get hot very easily, especially after firing several bolts, these weapons have a built-in cooling system which activates when the weapon becomes hotter than 60 °C. The cooling system cools the weapon by extracting nitrogen from the air, turning it into liquid nitrogen, and spraying it onto the barrel. On many handweapons, the cooling system can also be manually activated by a button.

Plasmatic handweapons, such as rifles and pistols, almost always have insulated grips and handles. It's a safety precaution not to touch the parts of the weapon that directly connect to the main weapon system.

A bolt produced by a plasmatic handweapon is very hard to see at daylight, but its observed to be a streak of the same color of the crystal used to create the plasma. Upon impact, these bolts of plasma typically produce a small flash of light, a cracking sound similar to a firecracker, and sparks. Injuries caused by plasmatic handweapons include 2nd to 3rd degree burns and can put a dent in concrete.

Of course, larger weapons such as mounted turrets produce more powerful bolts.

#### Mounted Turrets
Mounted turrets work the same way plasmatic weapons work, except on a bigger scale. Additionally, to assist turret operators, almost every mounted turret has a targeting system installed, telling them where they should aim to get the best shot. These targeting systems take average speed and movement direction into account.

#### Plasmatic Explosives
A plasmatic explosive detonates by surging its crystal core with a ridiculous amount of electricity, making it release a lot of explosive plasma. The energy released cannot escape anywhere, so it bursts through the shell, causing an explosion.

A KAG MN-12, shortened to MN-12, is a plasmatic pistol manufactured in the Kagalarian Empire. It uses a mrokek core.

Its containment field generator holds the plasma bolts using 1 kilojoule of energy.

#### KAG YP-P4 (KAG Yivniy Panovka Prototype 4)

A KAG YP-P4, shortened to MYP P-4, is a plasmatic rifle manufactured in the Kagalarian Empire. Instead of bolts, this rifle fires a beam of plasma by allowing a steady electrical current into its mrokek core.

Its containment field generator holds the plasma beam together using 2.5 kilojoules of energy.

## Plasmatic Explosives
#### Plasmatic Grenade
 - **Type:** Plasmatic Explosive
 - **Kill radius:** 3 meters
 - **Blast radius:** 7 meters
 - **Shock radius:** 15 meters

The grenade's shell is made of arsenium. After 5 seconds of the pin being pulled, the grenade's detonation mechanism activates.

## Mounted Turrets
#### All-Purpose Missile Launcher
 - **Type:** Mounted Turret
 - **Rate of Fire:** 30 rpm
 - **Projectile:** APMLMs
 - **Detection Range:** 8,000 kilometres (8 kacholnakins)
	
A missile launcher with a multi-purpose computing and launching system. Can be used to counter missiles and other projectiles, ships, ground structures, etc. These turrets are controlled by AI, which is connected to all other turrets, so the ship will always fire the most optimal missiles required. But ultimately, the target of these turrets is set in the control room of the spacecraft.

Missile launchers are too heavy to go onto smaller spacecraft such as civilian travelling vessels, but the minimum length requirement a ship must be in order to fly safely with a missile launcher installed is 50 meters.

#### Anti-Spacefighter Repeater
 - **Type:** Mounted Turret
 - **Rate of Fire:** 300 rpm
 - **Projectile:** Contained plasma bolt
 - **Muzzle Velocity:** 500 m/s
 - **Destruction Equivalent:** A stick of dynamite
 - **Effective Range:** 5 kilometers

Designed to destroy spacefighters.

#### Cannon
 - **Type:** Mounted Turret
 - **Rate of Fire:** 60 rpm
 - **Projectile:** Contained plasma bolt
 - **Muzzle Velocity:** 400 m/s
 - **Destruction Equivalent:** A landmine
 - **Effective Range:** 30 kilometers

An all-purpose weapon.

An all-purpose weapon mounted on spacefighters and other similar spacecraft.

#### Long-range Laser Projector

 - **Destruction Equivalent:** A stick of dynamite
 - **Effective Range:** 200 kilometres (0.2 kacholnakins)

A long-range laser projector is a laser-firing mounted turret, designed to attack ships that have a shield generator or are fast.

Instead of a bolt of supercompressed plasma, it shoots an intensely concentrated beam of light, otherwise known as a laser *(I can’t believe I have to explain this to people who think lasers are colourful bolts that fly)*. The colour of these weapons is always white, and they do not use a crystal core.

## Missiles & Projectiles
#### Crystal Warhead
The warhead is tipped with an unstable crystal. When this crystal is struck, it releases a high amount of explosive plasma. The crystal on the tip of the warhead is actually connected to a larger piece in the middle of the missile, which is enclosed in a hard metal. Because the unstable crystal released a lot of plasma, this plasma is contained inside the missile. The missile cannot contain this much plasma, so the missile explodes.

#### Pre-Computed Missile
A computed missile is a missile that follows a pre-computed path and explodes once it reaches the end of the path. The missile will also explode if the warhead physically hits anything.

#### All-Purpose Missile Launcher Missile (APMLM)
