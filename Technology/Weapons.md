## Plasmatic Rifles
#### KAG-MP-114 (KAG Fernuskaniy Panovka Model 114)
 - **Type:** Plasmatic Rifle
 - **Length:** ~70 centimeters
 - **Projectile:** Supercompressed plasma bolt
 - **Muzzle Velocity:** 330 m/s
 - **On impact:** Bolts explode in a small shower of sparks, burning whatever it touches.
 - **Effective Range:** ~500 meters

A KAG-MP-114 is a plasmatic rifle manufactured in the Kagalarian Empire.

This rifle fires a bolt by releasing a burst of electricity into a mrokek core. The core, due to its mineral properties, converts the electrical charge into explosive plasma and emits it back out.

Since this burst of explosive plasma has nowhere to go other than the barrel, a thick tube with a narrow interior, it shoots out of the barrel and becomes supercompressed due to the narrowness of the barrel. The supercompressed burst of plasma that comes out of the rifle is the bolt of plasma.

In an attempt to cool down the weapon from heating, the rifle has a built-in cooling system, which is done by taking some nitrogen from the air, turning it into liquid nitrogen, and running it through the barrel. Because of this, the metal of a plasmatic rifle that hasn’t been fired in a while will feel very cold.

#### KAG-YP-P4 (KAG Yivniy Panovka Prototype 4)
 - **Type:** Plasmatic Rifle
 - **Length:** ~110 centimeters
 - **Projectile:** Thin plasma beam
 - **Muzzle Velocity:** 330 m/s
 - **Effective Range:** ~50 meters

In the rifle, a continuous electrical current passes through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive plasma. The explosive plasma is pushed through a thin tube, shooting out like a deadly water cannon.

Concentrated Plasmatic Anti-Materiel Rifle
	Type:            Plasmatic "Laser" Rifle
	Length:          About 100 cm long
	Projectile:      Thin beam of plasma, 300 m/s
	Effective Range: 50 m
	Designs:
		KAG Stream Rifle Prototype 4

	In the rifle, a continuous electrical current passes through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive plasma. The explosive plasma is pushed through a thin tube, shooting out like a deadly water cannon.



Plasmatic Grenade
	Type:         Plasmatic Explosive
	Kill radius:  3 meters
	Blast radius: 7 meters

	The grenade's shell is made of arsenium. After 5 seconds of the pin being pulled, the grenade surges the mrokek core with a ridiculous amount of electricity, making it release a lot of explosive plasma. The explosive plasma cannot escape anywhere, and burst open the grenade.

[[MISSILES & PROJECTILES]]



Crystal Warhead
	Type: Warhead

	The warhead is tipped with an unstable crystal. When this crystal is struck, it releases a high amount of explosive plasma. The crystal on the tip of the warhead is actually connected to a larger piece in the middle of the missile, which is enclosed with a hard metal. Because the unstable crystal released a lot of plasma, this plasma is contained inside the missile. The missile cannot contain this much plasma, so the missile explodes.



Pre-Computed Missile
	Type: Crystal Missile
	
	A computed missile is a missile that follows a pre-computed path, and explodes once it reaches the end of the path. The missile will also explode if the warhead physically hits anything.



All-Purpose Missile Launcher Missile (APMLM)
	Missile Type:           Pre-Computed Missile
	Warhead:                Crystal Warhead
	Radius:                 30 cm
	Length:                 5 meters
	Speed:                  600 m/s
	Destruction Equivalent: 50 kilograms of tnt
	Fuel Capacity:          10,000 km (10 kacholnakins)
	
	Uses a crystal warhead and is propelled by a crystal rocket engine.
