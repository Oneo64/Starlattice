# Spacecraft
Spacecraft are advanced, highly-equipped vessels for space exploration and combat. They are usually made from the strongest and most stable metals available, since they must withstand the vacuum and various energies trying to break in.

Because spacecraft are so heavy, they rely on crystal-powered engines by convention. Almost every military spacecraft has some sort of long-distance travelling device, such as wormhole travel or engine overdrive. Teleportation is still unheard of and is, to this day, considered fantastical.

## Warships
Warships are large, bridge-steered military spacecraft designed for long endurance under combat pressure. They are longer than a hundred meters, since they usually require carrying tens of defensive turrets.

Their capacity for so many turrets and their hull thickness come with a tradeoff, which is that they are slower than most vessels without the help of long-distance travel. Because of this, many military spacecraft are installed with several defensive modules, with shielding being the most important.

Giant spacecraft, such as the Anora Vindaror M-8, are one-and-a-half kilometers long because they need to be able to transport troops over long distances.

## Spacefighters
Spacefighters are small cockpit-steered ships that usually only hold one or two people. They are faster and more agile, designed for a variety of things such as scouting and combat. Because they are manufactured with small cannons as a core part of them, a spacefighter model cannot automatically become a civilian model just by removing their guns.

## Civilian Ships
Civilian ships are small, usually unarmed and vulnerable ships that are sold to civilians. They can come in either cockpit-steered or bridge-steered.

## Modules
[Modules](ModulesAndAddons.md) can be installed into most spacecraft.
