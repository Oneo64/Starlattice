# Spacecraft
Spacecraft are advanced, highly-equipped vessels for space exploration and combat. They are usually made from the strongest and most stable metals available, since they must withstand the vacuum and various energies trying to break in.

Most spacecraft are only a few tens of meters long, but the largest in-use spacecraft can get up to two kilometers long.

Because spacecraft are so heavy, they rely on crystal-powered engines by convention. Almost every military spacecraft has some sort of long-distance travelling device, such as wormhole travel or engine overdrive. Teleportation is still unheard of and is, to this day, considered fantastical.
