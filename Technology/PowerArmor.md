# Power Armor
#### Power Armor base
A suit of power armour resembles an armoured and less clunkier astronaut suit.

The power armour's main armour part is a 1 cm thick titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). The visor of this power armour consists of two layers. The outer layer is made of tempered glass, tinted to prevent bright sunlight. The inner layer is made of laminated glass, just in case the outer layer shatters. The power armour can be turned on and off at any time.

The power armour opens on the front once it's shut off, and closes when it is turned on, allowing the wearer to step in and out at any time. Once it's shut and activated, it is completely airtight and bio-sealed, except when the visor is opened.

The inside of the power armour has a ventilation system and a backup oxygen cylinder (6 litres, 1200 litres of air at 200 bar) that can sustain 2.5 hours of breathing, or 24 minutes if the wearer is breathing heavily. The power armour also increases its wearer's lifting strength by about 50%.

**Standard modules installed in this power armor:**

 - **Power:** Portable Crystal Reactor
 - **Defensive:** *none*
 - **Scanning:** *none*
 - **Movement:** *none*
 - **Environmental:** Heat Regulation System
 - **Communication:** Speaker and Microphone

#### Military-grade Power Armor
A suit of military grade power armour is a variant of power armour designed to protect the wearer from war and explosions. It is much more durable than normal power armour. It can carry at most two of each module type. It can carry at most 10 modules. In the middle of the upper chest, there is a nameplate with the owner's title and name.

**Standard modules installed in this power armor:**

 - **Power:** Portable Crystal Reactor
 - **Defensive:** Wrist-Mounted Crystal Core Guns, Advanced Blast Protection Module
 - **Scanning:** Nightvision Camera
 - **Movement:** Striding Exoskeletons
 - **Environmental:** Heat Regulation System
 - **Communication:** Handheld Radio, Speaker and Microphone

#### Exploration Power Armor
A suit of exploration power armour is a variant of power armour designed to protect the wearer from all sorts of environmental hazards and monstrous threats. It can carry at most two of each module type. It can carry at most 12 modules. There is a thin 0.5 cm layer of lead built inside to protect the wearer from radiation.

This variant has a larger and stronger oxygen cylinder (7 litres, 1750 litres of air at 250 bar) that can sustain 3.5 hours of breathing, or 35 minutes if the wearer is breathing heavily.

**Standard modules installed in this power armor:**

 - **Power:** Portable Crystal Reactor
 - **Defensive:** Wrist-Mounted Crystal Core Guns
 - **Scanning:** Spotlight (on helmet), Nightvision Camera, Material Scanner (on hand)
 - **Movement:** Striding Exoskeletons, Hand-Based Burst Thrusters
 - **Environmental:** Heat Regulation System
 - **Communication:** Handheld Radio, Speaker and Microphone

## Power modules
#### Portable Crystal Reactor
A small reactor made of an unstable crystal. This works the same way a Crystal Core Reactor works, but on a smaller scale.

## Defensive modules
#### Advanced Point Laser Defense
A point laser defence point is a small automated laser turret built onto the armour. These lasers can reach up to 10 meters, and they use a mix of colour-based and heat-based targeting systems. Because of this, if the targeting system is set to "red", it may attack any warm-blooded creature or warm object that is colored a certain amount of red.

#### Advanced Blast Protection Shields
Blast protection shields are a forcefield that forms on the surface of the power armour. It protects from all forms of physical and energy attacks.

The shielding can take 20 AK-47 shots, 20 plasma blasts, 10 high-speed repeater plasma blasts, or 1 (and a half) artillery explosions (mortar) before it runs out of energy.

#### Blast Protection Shields
Blast protection shields are a forcefield that forms on the surface of the power armour. It protects from all forms of physical and energy attacks.

The shielding can take 5 AK-47 shots, 5 plasma blasts, 2 high-speed repeater plasma blasts, or subdue one artillery explosion (mortar) before it runs out of energy.

#### Landing Protection Thrusters
The landing protection thrusters can detect whether the user is moving too fast (more than 15 m/s) in the direction it is facing. If it detects that the user is moving too fast, it automatically activates, which will slow the user down.

#### Point Laser Defense
A point laser defence point is a small automated laser turret built onto the armour. These lasers can reach up to 10 meters, and they use a colour-based targeting system. Because of this, if the targeting system is set to "red", it may attack anyone who is wearing a certain amount of red. However, it may mistake a red flag or a red flower pot for an enemy and attack it instead.

#### Wrist-Mounted Crystal Core Guns
The wrist-mounted crystal core guns can fire a burst of three plasma bolts at a time.

## Scanning modules
#### Material Scanner
The material scanner is a scanning device that can be mounted anywhere. It takes a few seconds to scan, which will then send its data to a small screen. When the scan is complete, a list of the top 5 elements found in the scan is returned, including their composition percentage, periodic symbol, state of matter, and percentage of neutrons, protons, and electrons.

#### Nightvision and Heatvision Camera
The nightvision and heatvision cameras streamline data to a small screen inside the helmet.

#### Rangesight Camera
The rangesight camera is a camera that is designed to zoom in on faraway objects. Standing at 1 kilometre away, you should be able to see an apple on a table just clear enough to make out what it is.

## Movement modules
#### Jumping Thrusters
The jumping burst thrusters are an extremely weak version of a warship engine, capable of only releasing a quick burst of energy before heating up. When activated, these jump thrusters can be used to propel the user about 10 meters up in the air.

#### Hand-Based Burst Thrusters
The hand-based burst thrusters are an extremely weak version of a warship engine, capable of only releasing a quick burst of energy before heating up. When activated, these hand-based burst thrusters can be used to propel the user a meter in any direction. These thusters can also be used offensively, but the user must be at least a metre close to the intended target for the plasma exhaust to hit. Even though this plasma exhaust is around 350 degrees Celsius, it isn't hot enough to start a fire since the plasma dissipates into the air too quickly.

#### Striding Exoskeletons
This module is built on the back of the legs, which amplify the speed the user can run from 7 m/s to 14 m/s.

## Environmental modules
#### Heat Regulation System
The heat regulation system is self-explanatory; it allows the user to change the temperature in their armour. This module is effective only in temperatures -250 °C to 50 °C.

## Communication modules
#### Speaker and Microphone
The speaker and microphone allow clear communication outside the power armour.
