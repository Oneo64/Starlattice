# Power Armour
Power armour is a type of mechanical, form-fitting suit that provides protection against hazardous environments and hostile enemies. They appear as (usually white) metal suits with a clean, polished outer look. Between joints and at the belly, there is a folding-plate mechanism that provides a range of motion while preserving safety. Modern models are always bio-sealed with a backup oxygen tank, a safeguard in case of drowning, poisonous atmosphere, or disease.

## Modules
[Modules](ModulesAndAddons.md) can be installed onto power armour suits.

## Types of Power Armours
#### Power Armour base
The basis of power armour consists of a 1-centimeter-thick titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) as its main armour layer, with a padded inside for comfort. The visor is made of two layers: tempered and darkened glass for the outer layer, and laminated glass for the inner layer (just in case the outer layer shatters).

The power armour can be turned on and off at any time from the inside. Its front can also be opened and closed from the inside, allowing the wearer to step in and out at any time. Once it's shut and activated, it is completely airtight and bio-sealed, except when the visor is opened.

If the power armour is somehow shut and its owner isn't inside, they can use a pocket remote to open it.

The inside of the power armour has a ventilation system and a backup oxygen cylinder (6 litres, 1200 litres of air at 200 bar) that can sustain ~17 hours of breathing, or ~3 hours if the wearer is breathing heavily. The power armour also increases its wearer's lifting strength by about 50%.

Civilian power armour suits are expensive, of course. It is considered a luxury to own one, therefore not many people have one.

**Standard modules installed in this power armour:**

 - **Power:** Portable Crystal Reactor

#### Military-grade Power Armour
A suit of military-grade power armour is a variant of power armour designed to protect the wearer from war and explosions. It is much more durable than normal power armour. It can carry at most two of each module type. It can carry at most 10 modules. In the middle of the upper chest, there is a nameplate with the owner's title and name.

**Standard modules installed in this power armour:**

 - **Power:** Portable Crystal Reactor
 - **Defensive:** Advanced Blast Protection Module

#### Exploration Power Armour
A suit of exploration power armour is a variant of power armour designed to protect the wearer from various environmental hazards and monstrous threats. It can carry at most two of each module type. It can carry at most 12 modules. There is a thin 0.5 cm layer of lead built inside to protect the wearer from radiation, and then a thin plastic layer to prevent lead poisoning.

This variant has a larger and stronger oxygen cylinder (7 litres, 1750 litres of air at 250 bar) that can sustain ~24 hours of breathing, or ~4 hours if the wearer is breathing heavily.
