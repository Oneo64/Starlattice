[[DESIGN PHILOSOPHY]]
To make a spaceship, many things need to be considered to ensure the safety of it's crew members, staff, and other inhabitants. The hulls and inside structure is made of clean fresarmanite plating, and are painted black to camouflage with night time/space. Inside the hulls there is a sheet of lead 10 centimeters thick to make sure no space radiation enters. Between the lead and fresarmanite plating is a thin sheet of polyethylene to block out cosmic rays and radiation. There are also other things such as heat regulations, and for ships longer than 20 meters, an alarm and broadcasting system.

Inside the spaceship, there are no openings to the computing system of the spaceship other than strategic spots. Each spot is a small room with a computer machine that lets entry to the computing system, but is locked behind a door by a DNA scanner. Only trusted human personnel, such as a commander or the ship captain have their DNAs authorized in the door to prevent manipulation of human clones.

Computer programs and ship systems can only be manipulated at the command deck, which is also where the only place something can be injected into the ship. Even then the injection point is locked inside a metal covering where a commander is needed to access it.

Crucial areas such as the command deck, engine rooms, or the reactor/generator room requires the same DNA scanning system. Also only human personnel, mostly commanders, ship captains, repairmen, and guards have access to these rooms.

All military spacecraft have the Wormhole Transporter Module installed, and all military warships have the following modules installed: Shield Generator Module and Radar Module. Large military ships usually have a crystal core reactor and a solar energy system that powers it's systems.
