#### Cloning Machine
 - **Type:** Cloning Machine
 - **Height:** 3 meters
 - **Rate:** 1 clone per 12 hours

The cloning machine clones people by scanning their appearance, DNA, and other traits. The machine then uses a magical crystal to create the bones, flesh, organs, blood and other things.

To assign someone to clone, they step into the machine. The machine reads their body and their properties, like IQ, strength, height, weight, immune system, etc. The machine then takes a week to finish analysis and configuration. After that, the machine is ready to start cloning.

To grow a clone, it will take half a day. These machines only require two things to grow a clone: electricity to power them and water. Cloning people with a higher IQ, strength, size, attractiveness, etc, takes longer to clone.

#### Handheld Radio
 - **Type:** Radio
 - **Size:** 12 x 4 x 2 inches

Uses a magical crystal to send signals and another magical crystal to receive signals. Allows communication across galaxies. If the signal goes past 10 astronomical units, 1 meter of lead, or 200 meters underground, it starts to go fuzzy.

To talk to each other, you assign the radio to an ID. There can never be two radios with the same ID, and the radio will reject an ID if it already exists within 100 astronomical units. You connect to this ID on another radio with a password required. Then you can communicate. These radios are incompatible with normal radios.

#### Long-range Radio
 - **Type:** Radio
 - **Size:** 30 x 10 x 4 inches

Uses a larger magical crystal to send signals and another magical crystal to receive signals. Allows communication across galaxies. If the signal goes past 100 astronomical units, 10 meter of lead, or 1 kilometer underground, it starts to go fuzzy.

To talk to each other, you assign the radio to an ID. There can never be two radios with the same ID, and the radio will reject an ID if it already exists within 1,000 astronomical units. You connect to this ID on another radio with a password required. Then you can communicate. These radios are incompatible with normal radios.
