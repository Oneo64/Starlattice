## Magic Crystals
#### Mrokek
Mrokek is an unstable blue crystal that glows in the dark. Its instability is marked by darker, browner spots within the crystal, giving it a dirty appearance.

Because mrokek crystals are unstable, they are commonly used for weapons and explosives in the Kagalarian Empire. They are also the most prevalent type of crystal in Star System KA-A, making them a... "stable" ingredient in weapons production.

Since these crystals are classified as unstable, they generate plasma and expel it outwards when electricity is shot into them, making them semi-volatile.

#### Mroken
Mroken is a stable blue crystal that glows. Unlike mrokek, mroken doesn't have any darker or brown spots inside. These crystals are used for various miscellaneous things, such as heaters.

It's possible to destablise mroken into mrokek by shooting high amounts of radiation into the crystal (this is obviously very dangerous).
