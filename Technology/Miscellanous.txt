Cloning Machine
	Type:     Cloning Machine
	Height:   3 meters
	Rate:     1 clone per 12 hours
	
	The cloning machine clones people by scanning their appearance, dna, and other traits. The machine then uses a magical crystal to create the bones, flesh, organs, blood and other things. To assign someone to clone, they step into the machine. The machine reads their body, and their properties, like IQ, strength, height, weight, immune system, etc. The machine then takes a week to finish analyzation and configuration. After that, the machine is ready to start cloning. To grow a clone, it will take half a day to create one. These machines to not require any resource to create a clone, other than electricity to power it.



Handheld Radio
	Type:     Radio
	Size:     12 x 4 x 2 inches
	
	Uses a magical crystal to send signals, and another magical crystal to receive signals. Allows communication across galaxies. If the signal goes past 100 astronomical units, 1 meter of lead, or 200 meters underground, it starts to go fuzzy. To talk to each other, you assign the radio to an ID. There can never be two radios with the same ID. You connect to this ID on another radio with a password required. Then you can communicate. These radios are incompatible with normal radios.



Long-Range Radio
	Type:     Radio
	Size:     30 x 10 x 4 inches
	
	Uses a larger magical crystal to send signals, and another magical crystal to receive signals. Allows communication across galaxies. If the signal goes past 10,000 lightyears, 10 meters of lead, or 1 kilometer underground, it starts to go fuzzy. To talk to each other, you assign the radio to an ID. There can never be two radios with the same ID. You connect to this ID on another radio with a password required. Then you can communicate. These radios are incompatible with normal radios.
