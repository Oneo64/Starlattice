[[Weapons]]



Plasmatic Rifle
	Type:            Plasmatic Rifle
	Length:          About 60 cm long
	Projectile:      Bolt of supercompressed plasma, 300 m/s
	On impact:       The bolts explode in a small shower of sparks, burning what ever it touches.
	Effective Range: 500 m
	Designs:
		KAG Plasmatic Rifle 114 (KAGER 114, uses mrokek)
		Queendom's Rifle 3 (uses phystine)
		Reedian Plasmatic Rifle 15 (RER 15, uses exite)

	In the rifle, a fast, strong burst of electricity is released through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive plasma. This burst of explosive plasma is pushed through a thin tube out of the rifle, supercompressing it in the process. The supercompressed burst of plasma that comes out of the rifle is the bolt of plasma. In attempt to cool down the weapon from heating, the barrel is enclosed by a sealed tank of liquid nitrogen. Because of this, the metal of a plasmatic rifle that hasn't been fired in a while will feel very cold.



Concentrated Plasmatic Anti-Materiel Rifle
	Type:            Plasmatic "Laser" Rifle
	Length:          About 100 cm long
	Projectile:      Thin beam of plasma, 300 m/s
	Effective Range: 50 m
	Designs:
		KAG Stream Rifle Prototype 4

	In the rifle, a continuous electrical current passes through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive plasma. The explosive plasma is pushed through a thin tube, shooting out like a deadly water cannon.



Plasmatic Grenade
	Type:         Plasmatic Explosive
	Kill radius:  3 meters
	Blast radius: 7 meters

	The grenade's shell is made of arsenium. After 5 seconds of the pin being pulled, the grenade surges the mrokek core with a ridiculous amount of electricity, making it release a lot of explosive plasma. The explosive plasma cannot escape anywhere, and burst open the grenade.

	Destruction Equivalent: A grenade
	Effective Range:        5 km
	
	Designed to destroy spacefighters.



Cannon
	Type:                   Warship/Vehicle (See below) Turret
	Rate of fire:           1 seconds
	Projectile:             Bolt of supercompressed plasma, 400 m/s
	Destruction Equivalent: A landmine
	Effective Range:        30 km
	
	An all-purpose weapon.



High-Speed Repeater
	Type:                   Vehicle Turret
	Rate of Fire:           0.05 seconds
	Projectile:             Bolt of supercompressed plasma, 300 m/s
	Destruction Equivalent: A heavy machine gun
	Effective Range:        1 km
	
	Designed to mow down crowds of enemies.



Spacefighter Cannon
	Type:                   Fixed Gun
	Rate of Fire:           0.2 seconds
	Projectile:             Bolt of supercompressed plasma, 300 m/s, 500 m/s when shot from spacefighter whilst flying
	Destruction Equivalent: A grenade
	Effective Range:        5 km
	
	An all-purpose weapon mounted on spacefighters other similar spacecraft.



Long-Range Laser Projector
	Type:            Warship Turret
	Rate of Fire:    Continuous
	Projectile:      A beam of intensely concentrated light. The color of these weapons are always white, and does not use a crystal core.
	Effective Range: 200 km
	
	Designed to attack ships with shield generators.



Ground Turret
	Type: Any Turret (High-speed, anti-spacefighter, and cannon turrets)

	Designed to destroy vehicles and other transport.

[[MISSILES & PROJECTILES]]



Crystal Warhead
	Type: Warhead

	The warhead is tipped with an unstable crystal. When this crystal is struck, it releases a high amount of explosive plasma. The crystal on the tip of the warhead is actually connected to a larger piece in the middle of the missile, which is enclosed with a hard metal. Because the unstable crystal released a lot of plasma, this plasma is contained inside the missile. The missile cannot contain this much plasma, so the missile explodes.



Pre-Computed Missile
	Type: Crystal Missile
	
	A computed missile is a missile that follows a pre-computed path, and explodes once it reaches the end of the path. The missile will also explode if the warhead physically hits anything.



All-Purpose Missile Launcher Missile (APMLM)
	Missile Type:           Pre-Computed Missile
	Warhead:                Crystal Warhead
	Radius:                 30 cm
	Length:                 5 meters
	Speed:                  600 m/s
	Destruction Equivalent: 50 kilograms of tnt
	Fuel Capacity:          10,000 km
	
	Uses a crystal warhead and is propelled by a crystal rocket engine.
