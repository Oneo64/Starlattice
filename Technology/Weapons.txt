[[Weapons]]



Energy Rifle
	Type: Energy rifle
	Length: About 60 cm long
	Projectile: Bolt of energy, 300 m/s
	On impact: The bolts explode in a small shower of sparks, burning what ever it touches.
	Effective Range:        500 m
	Designs:
		KAG Energy Rifle 114 (KAGER 114, uses mrokek)
		Queendom's Rifle 3 (uses phystine)
		Reedian Energy Rifle 15 (RER 15, uses exite)

	In the rifle, a fast, strong burst of electricity is released through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive energy. This burst of explosive energy is pushed through a thin tube out of the rifle, supercompressing it in the process. The supercompressed burst of energy that comes out of the rifle is the bolt of energy. In attempt to cool down the weapon from heating, the barrel is enclosed by a sealed tank of liquid nitrogen. Because of this, the metal of an energy rifle that hasn't been fired in a while will feel very cold.



Concentrated Energy Rifle
	Type: Energy Rifle
	Length: About 100 cm long
	Projectile: Thin beam of energy, 300 m/s
	Effective Range:        50 m
	Designs:
		KAG Stream Rifle Prototype 4

	In the rifle, a continuous electrical current passes through a crystal core, creating high amounts of explosive energy. The explosive energy is pushed through a thin tube, shooting out like a deadly water cannon.



Energy Grenade
	Type:         Energy grenade
	Kill radius:  3 meters
	Blast radius: 7 meters

	The grenade's shell is made of arsenium. After 5 seconds of the pin being pulled, the grenade surges the mrokek core with a ridiculous amount of electricity, making it release a lot of explosive energy. The explosive energy cannot escape anywhere, and burst open the grenade.

[[MOUNTED TURRETS]]



High-Speed Repeater
	Type:                   Vehicle Turret

	Destruction Equivalent: A heavy machine gun
	Effective Range:        1 km
	
	Designed to mow down crowds of enemies.



Anti-Spacefighter Repeater
	Type:                   Warship Turret
	Rate of Fire:           0.1 seconds
	Projectile:             Bolt of energy, 500 m/s
	Destruction Equivalent: A grenade
	Effective Range:        5 km
	
	Designed to destroy spacefighters.



Spacefighter Cannon
	Type:                   Fixed Gun
	Rate of Fire:           0.2 seconds
	Projectile:             Bolt of energy, 300 m/s, 500 m/s when shot from spacefighter whilst flying
	Destruction Equivalent: A grenade
	Effective Range:        5 km
	
	An all-purpose weapon.



Cannon
	Type:                   Warship/Vehicle (See below) Turret
	Rate of fire:           1 seconds
	Projectile:             Bolt of energy, 400 m/s
	Destruction Equivalent: A landmine
	Effective Range:        30 km
	
	An all-purpose weapon.



All-Purpose Missile Turret
	Type:            Warship Turret
	Rate of Fire:    2 seconds
	Projectile:      Computed missiles
	Sensory Range:   5,000 km
	
	Designed to destroy big, slow, and tanky ships. Can also be used to destroy missiles, and other projectiles. These turrets are controlled by AI, which is connected to all other turrets, so the ship will always fire the most optimal missiles required. They can also be controlled manually via the control room.



Long-Range Laser Projector
	Type:            Warship Turret
	Rate of Fire:    Continuous
	Projectile:      A beam of intensely concentrated light. The color of these weapons are always white, and does not use a crystal core.
	Effective Range: 200 km
	
	Designed to attack ships with shield generators



Ground Turret
	Type: Any Turret (High-speed, anti-spacefighter, and cannon turrets)

	Designed to destroy vehicles and other transport.

[[MISSILES & PROJECTILES]]



Computed Missile
	Type:            Crystal Missile
	Effective Range: 10,000
	
	The missile follows a pre-computed path, and explodes once it reaches the end of the path. The missile will also explode if the warhead physically hits anything.



Crystal Warhead
	Type: Warhead

	The warhead is tipped with an unstable crystal. When this crystal is struck, it releases a high amount of explosive energy. The crystal on the tip of the warhead is actually connected to a larger piece in the middle of the missile, which is enclosed with a hard metal. Because the unstable crystal released a lot of energy, this energy is contained inside the missile. The missile cannot contain this much energy, so the missile explodes.



All-Purpose Missile Launcher Missile
	Type:    Computed Missile
	Warhead: Crystal Warhead
	Radius:  30 cm
	Length:  5 meters
	Speed:   600 m/s
	Destruction Equivalent: 50 kilograms of tnt
	
	Uses a crystal warhead, propelled by a crystal rocket engine.
