# Radios
Radios, just like the ones in our world, are portable sound transmitters allowing long-range communication. They come in three main forms: civilian, handheld, and military-grade.

## Civilian Radios
Civilian radios are small, moderately heavy radios that are used to listen to radio stations, advertisements, and music. Unlike other types of radios, they cannot send messages.

## Handheld Radios
Handheld radios are small radio devices that fit into one's hand, used as a quick way to communicate between members of large organisations, such as law enforcement and the military. They typically have a range of one astronomical unit.

To use the radio, the user or manufacturer must assign it a unique ID. After that, they need to set a specific three- to seven-letter code to their radio, corresponding to the code that their group uses.

Once set, the user can send live voice messages to other radios by specifying an ID and/or a broadcast range.

## Military-grade Radios
Military-grade radios are large, heavy-duty radios that can only be fixed to the ground or carried on vehicles. These radios, however, are favoured in military environments since their broadcast range is so great that any radio across a star system can receive their messages. The reason they are so powerful is that they use a large magical crystal, which is also why they are so heavy.

These radios use the same identification system as handheld radios, requiring an ID and a code before they can be used.

The limitation of these radios is that after several hundred astronomical units, or through around 40 meters of thick material (like concrete), their messages will start to go fuzzy and eventually disappear.
