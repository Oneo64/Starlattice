# Radios
Radios, just like the ones in our world, are portable sound transmitters allowing long-range communication. They come in three main forms: civilian, handheld, and military-grade.

## Civilian Radios
Civilian radios are small, moderately heavy radios that most people use. They are similar to a visual-less TV that is easier to carry around. Since these are for civilians, they cannot broadcast messages and are used for radio stations, advertisements, and music.

## Handheld Radios
Handheld radios are small radio devices that fit into one's hand, used as a quick way to communicate between members of large organisations, such as law enforcement and the military. However, every radio is encoded.

Getting past that encryption requires the person (or the manufacturer) to set a unique ID for that radio. After that, they need to set a specific three- to seven-letter code to their radio, corresponding to the code that their group uses.

Once set, the user can send live voice messages to other radios by specifying an ID and/or a broadcast range.

## Military-grade Radios
Military-grade radios are large, heavy-duty radios that cannot be carried. They are fixed to the ground as machines or carried on vehicles. These radios, however, are favoured in military environments since their broadcast range is so great that any radio across a star system can receive their messages.

These radios are so powerful because they use a large magical crystal, which is also why they are so heavy.

The limitation of these radios is that after a few hundred thousand astronomical units, or through several meters of thick material, their messages will start to go fuzzy and eventually disappear.
