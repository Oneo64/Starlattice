The **Kagalarian Empire**, known formally as the **Empire of Kagalar**, also known in its native language as *Кшавико ожан Кагалар*, is an interstellar power that is in control of a dozen planets.

## Law
Here's a list of crimes that are commitable in the Kagalarian Empire.

#### Crimes (not finished, right now only lists out the non-obvious ones)
 - **Unlawful Possession of Plasmatic Weapon:** All plasmatic weapons must have a valid license, and the weapon bearer must also have a valid license.
 - **Improper Weapon Building:** It is a crime to build plasmatic weapons that do not have a cooling system, or with a cooling system that cannot keep the weapon under 250 °C. Plasmatic weapons that don't have these requirements could overheat to the point that they either melt or become very hazardous.

## Military
The Kagalarian Empire has about 8 billion troops, having around 600 million on each planet. Each troop are trained for about a month before they become eligible for deployment, but will continue training after the month. Pistols are trained to be shot with one hand and their torso turned sideways. Their space fleet consists of 130 battleships, a thousand carriers, four thousand destroyers, and three hundred thousand spacefighters.

Military ranks are from highest to lowest: Emperor, High Commander, Commander, Captain, and Infantry.

A captain controls 4 infantry, and one captain and 4 infantry make a squad.

A commander can give orders to 4 captains; however, a commander usually doesn't participate in the frontlines. A commander would usually be assigned an exploration, scouting, escorting, or stealth mission, with an assigned traveller ship and a small crew of operators.

A high commander is in command of a battleship. Each high commander controls a crew of commanders.

A space fleet usually consists of one battleship, flanked by 4 capital ships, each flanked by 4 destroyers (making 16 destroyers in total).

#### Cloning technology
The Kagalarian Empire has heavily utilized cloning technology to create a sizable portion of its army. The Kagalarian Army consists of 13% clones of humans; the rest are non-clones.

To prevent clones from betraying allies or freaking out upon creation, they have been biologically preprogrammed (rewiring brain cells) before being awakened from their initial coma.

#### Main base
The Kagalarian main base is built on a hill, surrounded by snowy coniferous forests. The entrance is built on its side, and it reaches down into the earth. There are 6 floors in the main Kagalarian base, each floor being about 10 meters in height, and 400 meters in width and length. On the hill, there are 4 APMT systems and 8 anti-spacefighter repeaters. The entrance has a large 10x30 meter gate, and to its right, there is a smaller door.

There is a runway connecting the gate to a nearby air and spacecraft field. The spacecraft field has a few carriers, destroyers, and many spacefighters.

The ground level is a vehicle storage with many vehicles such as cars, armoured cars, tanks, etc.

This military base is about 20 kilometres north of Jovikal.

 - **Combative high-rank uniforms:** A military-grade power armour painted black, with a blue Kagalarian Insignia on the front and back. Removing/not having the default modules is punishable, but additional modules may be added, except for point laser defences.
 - **Nameplates:** All military personnel, soldiers included, have a nameplate placed at the top middle of their surcoat/overcoat, where their chests are. The nameplate displays their Kagalarian names (which are in Cyrillic), except for clones, whose nameplates will display their ID.
 - **Gloves:** All weapon-bearing military personnel, soldiers included, will be given a set of heat-resistant gloves and are required to wear them when handling their weapon to prevent accidental burn injury.

A formal uniform is worn by high-ranked military personnel (the emperor, commanders, high commanders) when they are sent as military representatives or sent to a meeting in another nation, faction, or power. This is done to appear as less threatening and as less intimidating as possible.
