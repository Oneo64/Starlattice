How magic works:
	Each magic user has many magic cells in their body. When one learns magic, they gain a some magic cells, associated with the type of magic learned.

	When you first learn magic, the first week or two, you become weak. This is your immune system reacting to the magic cells, because your immune system thinks these new cells are dangerous. After the week, your immune system learns that these cells are actually beneficial, so they ignore it.

	Over years, your normal cells slowly gets replaced by magic cells. Because magic cells are magic, natural selection says magic cells are better and they multiply, taking over your body (you don't lose control over your body).
	The more these magic cells make your collective cell count, you get these benefits:
		Age slower (Live up to 500 years old at max benefit)
		Requires less sleep, can stay awake longer without going insane (you will still feel tired after a normal period of time)
		More resistant to cancer
		More resistant to sicknesses, diseases, poison, viruses, and other intruders
		Has more stamina

		Less likely to forget things

		Can think faster
		Can solve problems faster

		Better eyesight

		If the magic is an element, more resistant to it
			(example: fire mages are resistant to fire, jack-of-all-trades wizards are slightly resistant to every magic)

	ASPECTS:        Aspects are usually like a superpower, and enables users to do things related to them.
	MARTIAL SPELLS: Martial Spells are a collection of spells that share the same way to cast them. Martial Spells are more commonly known as schools of magic.

	You can have multiple aspects and spells, and you are ALWAYS resistant to your own magic. Once you gain an aspect, you become an aspected human. You are still a human, just an aspected one. Think of this as a really strong guy who works out every day.

	Martial Spells:
		Runic (This magic is cast by thinking the spell you want to cast. You make a fist with any hand, think the spell you want to cast, then open your hands. There will be a magic circle on your palm. To actually use it, you "throw" the spell at a target. You can also press your palm on a surface. Thinking of a spell usually means thinking of a short sequence of ancient and mystic words.)
			Runic Pain:      Shoot a bolt of purple and blue. This spell causes a wound and some pain on what it hit.
			Runic Explode:   Shoot a very fast bolt of purple and blue. This spell creates a purple and blue explosion.
			Runic Enchant:   Enchant an object with an aspect, which can be activated by a user of that aspect.
			Runic Push:      Pushes an object away.
			Runic Find:      Shoot a rune which will slowly find it's way to an item you have seen. It doesn't work if it is impossible (no path, no such item).
			Runic Aspect:    Mimic an aspect. You can have it last to a minute or below. This mimicry cannot be something like shooting beams or bolts of the aspect.
			Runic Raise:     Raises a body, turning it into a temporary zombie.
			Summon Golem:    Shoot a faint ball of purple. This ball will make an inactive golem active. Instructions on how to make one can be found below. For every meter the golem is in height (or length, pick the longest one), the summoning will take 20 minutes. The golem's limbs will slowly connect together. The golem will then obey your command. If it is attacked, it will automatically defend itself.
			Link Golem Rune: You must press this spell in place. This spell is essential for golem creation.

Golem creation:
	To create a golem, put long objects in place shown below:
		O
	  O O O
	  O O O
	   O O
	   O O

	Each "O" represents the long object. Connect the pieces together with the spell "Link Golem Rune". Once it has been done, the golem is ready for activation.
