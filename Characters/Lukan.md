## Appearance

## Personality
Lukan is loyal and has a good heart, yet he doesn't like to talk a lot. He tries to stay a good person by sticking to rules and being generous with sharing, but sometimes his underlying laziness can take over.

However, Lukan is aloof and doesn't trust strangers easily, so much so that he's always looking to see if anyone might be looking for a fight, if he is strong or vulnerable standing in a specific spot versus another, or having the underlying thought that someone is trying to poison him.

When he is asked about his injuries, Lukan acts indifferent. He doesn't really care that he was hurt, only that he doesn't want it to happen again. Sometimes, he even feels exasperated and annoyed with the way some people are uncomfortable with it.

Despite his quietness, Lukan has the habit of talking to himself, saying things like "There we go!" or "What is this bullshit?"

## Abilities
#### Standard Infantry Training & Martial Combat
Lukan received standard infantry training in the Kagalarian army. This includes reloading plasma rifles and pistols quicker, assembling and disassembling them, unjamming them, etc.

Furthermore, he is proficient in Dagsar, a mandatory martial art taught to soldiers and a common practice in Kagalar.

#### Languages
Lukan's native language is Kagalarian. He also knows how to speak English.

## Backstory
Before cloning was a thing, Lukan was 19 years old when he joined the Kagalarian army as an infantryman. He was sent to the planet Ramalosedot, where he fought his first battle, the Battle for Samandol. The battle was a total disaster for him. Not only was he shot three times and had to be sent to the hospital, but the Kagalarians lost the battle.

In his second deployment, the Battle of Sarvikal (a city on Estofear), he was shot again. Twice on his chest and four times on his back. Surprisingly, he also survived the assault, even though he was hospitalised again and didn't recover for six months.

After that second incident, he retired and joined the SMRK as an explorer.
