[[LORE]]
Amolov was created by two men, Kozrik and Sornarik. The two scientists were aiming to create human-like clones, complete with emotion, free will, and empathy. But just as a safeguard, before they mechanically woke the clone from unconsciousness, they planted a chip into the clone to activate it's deep emotions and free will after a week so that he wouldn't freak out as soon as he woke up, and specifically programmed him to never question his existence.

When the emperor heard of this, he employed Amolov as one of the military's battle strategists.
