He likes to eat steak.

[[LORE]]
Lukhan joined the military at 19 years old.

In a battle against the Seenians, he was shot three times, but he survived. Later, in another battle, he was shot again, twice on his chest, and four times on his back. Suprisingly, he also survived. One time, he defended a military camp by himself, killing about 20 seenians in total.

He was promoted to Captain. A few years later at 25 years old, Lukhan caught a Seenian spy in Horindun City during his visit to his family. He captured the spy, then took her to the nearest military base blindfolded, tied, and knocked out cold. After this, High Commander Garinor made Lukhan a commander, and assigned him wormhole operator and battleship security overseer.
