Backstory: Lukhan grew up in the village Haravikred. He was born in a warrior's family, and went to a warrior's school. But he dropped out, and ended up going to a mage's school. From there, he learned magic. One day, he decides to go have a look in an ancient ruin, and meets Forgo there. They become friends. After that, Lukhan joins the military. In a battle against the Seenians, he was shot three times, but he survived. Later, in another battle, he was shot again, twice on his chest, and four times on his back. Suprisingly, he also survived. One time, he defended a military camp by himself, killing about 20 seenians in total. He was promoted to Leader. Later, he started to get quite powerful. The High Commander saw Lukhan getting strong, so he made Lukhan a commander, and invited him into the Ovgot.
