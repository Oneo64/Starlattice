He was promoted to Captain. A few years later at 25 years old, Lukhan caught a Seenian spy in Horinsoler City during his visit to his family. He captured the spy, then took her to the nearest military base blindfolded, tied, and knocked out cold. After this, High Commander Garinor made Lukhan a commander, and assigned him wormhole operator and battleship security overseer.
