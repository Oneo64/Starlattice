Gomvar Latassenva, a new employee in the SMRK for one and a half months, works as a ship loader where he loads and unloads cargo with trading and expedition vessels.

## Appearance
Gomvar has brown hair, black eyes, and a round face. His beard is shaven, and he has naturally rosy cheeks. He has forehead wrinkles from squinting his eyes at far objects.

## Personality
Even though Gomvar is a calm and mature man with a warm heart, who likes to see other people succeed, he may be arrogant in his own greatness. He is also a gullible person, easily convinced to go do something with someone as long as he doesn't see anything bad in it.

The only type of restaurants Gomvar likes to eat at are casual dining restaurants where they serve heavy foods.

After quitting his old job as a commercial actor, Gomvar joined the SMRK as a space explorer because he thought it would be like a fun vacation. Initially, he was quite disappointed that he was assigned as a ship loader, but right now, he is aiming to be promoted to explorer.

## Abilities
#### Language
Gomvar speaks Kagalarian.
